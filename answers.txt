ANSWERS:

Here is how I would recommend putting in the SQL commands in app.py under the to-dos:

1.  Subject: 
        SELECT *
        FROM "work" 
        LEFT JOIN "subject"
        ON "work".work_id = "subject".work_id
        WHERE "subject".subject = '{name}'
        LIMIT 25

2.  Style:
        SELECT * 
        FROM "work"
        LEFT JOIN "subject"
        ON "work".work_id = "subject".work_id
        WHERE "work".style = '{name}'
        LIMIT 25

3. Museum:
        SELECT *
        FROM "work"
        LEFT JOIN "subject"
        ON "work".work_id = "subject".work_id
        WHERE "work".museum_id = '{name}'
        LIMIT 25

SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM public."Dhall" as dh
LEFT JOIN public."{name}_Calories" as c ON c."Name" = dh."Name"
WHERE "Location" ILIKE '%{name}%'

SELECT *
FROM public."Dhall"
WHERE "Ingredients" ILIKE '%{name}%' 

SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM public."Dhall"
WHERE "Meal Type" ILIKE '%{name}%'
